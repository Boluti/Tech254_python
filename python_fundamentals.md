# Dictionaries in Python
In Python, dictionaries are used to store key-value pairs. The key is a reference to an object, and the value is the data storage mechanism you want to use.

student_1 = {
    "name": "Anees",
    "stream": "DevOps",
    "completed_lessons": 4,
    "completed_lesson_names": ["Variables", "Data Types", "Operators"]
}
print(student_1)

#Access Data using its keys
print(student_1["stream"])
print(student_1["completed_lesson_names"][0])


Changing Values in a dictionary
#Editing the value of the completed lessons key
student_1["completed_lessons"] = 3
#Printing the updated dict
print(student_1["completed_lessons"])

student_1["completed_lesson_names"].remove("Data Types")
print(student_1["completed_lesson_names"])
Sets
# Sets and frozen sets - there is no order

car_parts = {"wheels", "doors", "exhaust", "windows"}
print(car_parts)
car_parts.add("steering_wheel")
print(car_parts)
car_parts.discard("windows")
print(car_parts)
Boolean Operations
Booleans are a data type representing truth values, with true and false being the two possible values

We have two Boolean variables a and b.

a = True
b = False
print( a == b)
print ( a != b)
print( a >= b)
print(a <= b)
In the above code we are comparing the two variables, and are receiving outputs about whether they are true or false.

String operations
We can also use operations on string to check if they satisfy a condition or not. In the first print, we are checking if "hi" contains orly alphabetical characters or not, and in this case it does so it will return true

hi = "Hello World"
#Check if "hi" is any of the following
print(hi.isalpha())
print(hi.islower())
print(hi.endswith("!"))
Data types + operators
Python is a dynamic language which means data types do not need to be specified, the interpreter will automatically assign the correct data type to the variable when it is declared.

# Slicing a String - Begin from the 4th index
hw = "Hello world!"
print(hw[4:])

# Stripping Whitespace
strip_string = "Hi my name is Anees                               "
print(len(strip_string))
print((len(strip_string.strip())))

# Counting Substrings
example_text = "Here's some text with lot's of text"
print(example_text.count("text"))

# String Manipulation
print(example_text.lower())
print(example_text.capitalize())
print(example_text.replace("with", "without"))

# Casting and Arithmetic
a = 2
b = 5.4
c = "3"
print(a + b + int(c))

# F-Strings - Used to ignore the hassle of formating sentences
name = "Lassie"
years = "7"
height_cm = "60.2"
print(f"{name} is {years} years old and {height_cm} cm tall")

# Percentages -  Use :.0% to convert into a 0 decimal place percentage
score = 16
max_score = 26
print(f"You scored {score/max_score}")
print(f"You scored {score/max_score:.2%}")
print(f"You scored {score/max_score:.0%}")
List and Tuples
Lists
Lists contains values at indexes, and items in the list can be accessed, removed or replaced.

shopping_list = ["Salad", "Eggs", "Doughnuts", "Milk", "Salmon"]

# Modify a list element
shopping_list[2] = "Tomato"

# List Methods
shopping_list.remove("Salad")
shopping_list.pop(2)
shopping_list.append("Carrots")
shopping_list.extend(["Water", "Celery"])

print(shopping_list)
Mixed data type lists
We can also have different types of data within the same list

mixture = [1, 2, 3.0, "one", "Two", "three"]

print(mixture)
print(mixture[1:3])
print(mixture[-2::])
#Will print the list backwards
print(mixture[::-1])
Tuples
Tuples are immutable, which means they cannot be changed or edited.

essentials = ("Bread", "Eggs", "Milk")
print(essentials)
